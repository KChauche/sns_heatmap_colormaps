# Seaborn Heatmap Color Schemes

### Background
Seaborn is a module commonly used for data visualizations. It ss useful in its ability to customize visualizations to a higher degree than matplotlib. This module is built on top of matplotlib, and so many of the keywords you would use in functions in matplotlib are applicable in functions within this module as well. 

### Purpose
This project is a simple demonstration of what each colormap in Seaborn appears as when applied. Having this available to the visualization community would make a valuable tool, as it would save other people time doing trial-and-error trying to find the right color map to use for their figure. 

This project will be posted on my blog: LINK 

In the blog there will be more information about colorblindness and which colormaps will still be understandable to people with different variations of colorblindness. This will not only help data visualization figures appear more pleasing to the eye, but it will also make the figures more accessible. # sns_heatmap_colormaps
